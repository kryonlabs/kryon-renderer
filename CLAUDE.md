# AI Guide

This project's quality is maintained through a strict, test-driven workflow. Your primary goal is to make tests pass.

Refer to the `ROADMAP.md` file for your list of tasks.

## Core Testing Principle

We use **snapshot testing** on the `kryon-ratatui` backend. Its text-based output provides a deterministic "source of truth" to verify visual correctness.

## The Testing Feedback Loop

1.  A test is created for a new feature or bug. It will initially fail.

2.  The test is run with the command:
    ```bash
    cargo test -p kryon-ratatui
    ```

3.  The text-based visual difference is captured using:
    ```bash
    cargo insta review
    ```

4.  You will be provided with the **`diff`** generated by `insta`. This `diff` is your only feedback.

5.  Your task is to modify the code to make the `diff` disappear.

A **passing test** is the only measure of success.
